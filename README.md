<B>MOVIEWATCHLIST</B>


Here is our moviewatchlist app! Its a simple app running in terminal which is using an API and making a watchlist of the movies which you would like to watch and not to forget about them to watch.
The app has a menu where you can <B>check your Watchlist, Search a Movie or see your Search History</B>.
Inside your Watchlist you can remove the movie or check its <B>Plot</B>
The app is creating a database, and saving the information about the movie from API, so it means that if you will search the movie again it will take the info from our database, not from the json.

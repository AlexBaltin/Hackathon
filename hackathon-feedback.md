## Impressions:
First of all - amazing work. There are a lot of stuff that you did great:
- [x] Code structure. As you may noticed before the first thing that I like to emphasize is a readability of code. Good code is easy to read. And here is that case.
- [x] Scope. You planned a list of features really smart and as I see built it all.
- [x] Logic. Also very straightforward and neat.
- [x] Experience. I see that you used a lot of knowledges from the lessons.


## Improvements
First of all lets talk about the private methods and public. What do you think, do we need to have all the methods as public? I consider it's important in terms of proper abstractions. So one thing that I want you think about is how to define private/public methods in your app(small hint – db access I strongly recommend you to hide).

Error handling – Also the thing that you can improve in methods where you asking for a user answer and the title, for example, can be a non-existing value.

Feature list – it is a good code and fully completed, but as for me it looks like you can do more complex apps now, next time I recommend you to go even further and enlarge your scope of features.

Finally, good work, congrats!
